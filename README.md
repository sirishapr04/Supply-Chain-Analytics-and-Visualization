# Supply Chain Analytics - Just In Time Company

## Project Background
In today's competitive business environment, maintaining operational efficiency within the supply chain is crucial for long-term success.Just In Time, a leading company in the global logistics and supply chain industry, is facing several challenges that hinder its ability to meet customer demands and optimize profitability. Key issues such as shipment delays, inconsistent inventory management, and difficulties in balancing supply with demand are negatively impacting business operations. The company provides tailored solutions for managing shipments and inventory, using data from 2015 to 2017, and serves diverse markets with a wide array of products across different regions. Addressing these challenges through data-driven insights is critical to ensuring improved performance and maintaining a competitive edge. The overarching goal for Just In Time Company is to streamline operations, enhance inventory management, and minimize delays in product deliveries to better meet customer expectations.

## Business Problems
1. Shipment Delays: Delays in delivering products to customers are leading to dissatisfaction and lost revenue. These delays are most prominent in key regions such as Latin America and Africa, where logistical inefficiencies are more pronounced. The inability to meet on-time delivery expectations is straining customer relationships and reducing overall business efficiency.

2. Inventory Management Issues: Overstocking and stockouts are frequent due to poor demand forecasting and uneven inventory distribution. Overstocking leads to higher storage costs, while stockouts result in missed sales opportunities and frustrated customers. The challenge lies in finding the right balance between ensuring product availability and minimizing excess inventory costs.

3. Supply and Demand Imbalances: Certain product categories experience significant supply-demand mismatches. While some products face consistent demand, others struggle with high delays or low turnover rates, leading to either overstock or stockouts. This misalignment impacts both revenue and operational efficiency.

4. Lack of Customer Segmentation Insights: The company lacks a detailed understanding of customer purchasing behaviors across different regions and product categories. Without these insights, it's difficult to make informed decisions about product promotion, inventory allocation, and targeted marketing strategies.

## Goals of the Analysis
1. Reduce Shipment Delays: Analyze and identify the root causes of delivery delays, particularly in underperforming regions, and implement logistical improvements to ensure faster and more reliable deliveries.

2. Optimize Inventory Levels: Implement strategies to better manage inventory by aligning stock levels with actual demand, reducing storage costs, and preventing stockouts.

3. Balance Supply and Demand: Improve supply chain processes to address mismatches in supply and demand, ensuring that high-demand products are available in the right regions at the right time.

4. Enhance Customer Insights: Use data analytics to gain deeper insights into customer behavior and purchasing trends. This will enable more targeted marketing efforts, better inventory planning, and a more personalized customer experience.
